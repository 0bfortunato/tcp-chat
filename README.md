### Run with docker
To run with docker, you will need navigate to root directory and run the command `docker build -t <name:tag> .`

After this, you'll need run an container with this image, so:
`docker run -dp 80:8080 -it --name <container-name> <name:tag>`

e.g: `docker build -t tcp-chat:v1` and after `docker run -dp 80:8080 -it --name go-chat tcp-chat:v1`

And finally, `telnet localhost 80` 
Voil√†, you are connected!
